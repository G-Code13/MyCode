          <h2 class="leftHeading">Understanding the Art of Graffiti</h2>
            <p>The common expression "to take to the streets" has been used for years to reflect a diplomatic arena for people to protest, riot, or rebel. Early graffiti writers of the 1960s and 70s embraced this philosophy as they began to tag their names across the urban landscapes of New York City, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. As graffiti bloomed outward across the U.S., Street Art evolved to encompass any visual art created in public locations, specifically unsanctioned artwork</p>

            <p>The underlying drive behind Street Art grew out of the belief that art should function in opposition to, and sometimes even outside of, the authority system of laws, property, and ownership. It needed to be accessible, rather than hidden away inside galleries, museums, and private collections; and be democratic and empowering, in that all people (regardless of race, age, gender, economic status, etc.) should be able to create art and have it be seen by others. Although some street artists do create installations or sculpture, they are more widely known for the use of unconventional art mediums such as spray paint, stencils, wheat paste posters, and stickers. Street Art has also been called independent public art, post-graffiti, and guerilla art.</p>

            <p>London has always been well ahead of other capital cities in terms of architecture, design, fashion and music, and the same can be said about its street art scene.</p>

            <p>When street art was becoming a thing in other major cities around the world, street artists in London were already painting the town red with their eye-opening, jaw-dropping canvases which were plastered all over the city walls, factories, buildings, bridges and even store shutters.</p>

        <h3 class="botMiddle">Local Graffiti</h3>
          <p>Often overlooked in favor of larger cities like Nashville, Chattanooga, Tennessee has a thriving street art and mural culture if you know where to look. There are many neighborhoods beyond the tourist district that have been revitalized with colorful paint.</p>
          <p>Most of these works are commissioned, rather than illegal “tags,” and are by local artists rather than those brought in. Groups like Public Art Chattanooga and The McCallie Walls Mural Project have set up these projects. For a list of murals around town, visit this page from the Chattanooga Convention & Visitor's Bureau.</p>

      <h3 class="botRight">Amsterdam Graffiti</h3>
        <p>Amsterdam has a rich, so called street art scene, where graffiti plays an important role. Much of this young people activity is closely connected to some sorts of music as hip hop, a few sport disciplines as skating and BMX biking, selected video games and a specific fashion. Groups of graffiti artists call themselves crews. Amsterdam crews like USA (United Street Artists), TMP, 3rd Eye or LF (The Lame Face) exist now for about fifteen years.</p>
